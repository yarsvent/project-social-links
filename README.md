## My process
I used Krita to research the design and measure the dimensions using the ruler tool, then I converted from px to rem.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use Krita when Figma designs are not available.

### Continued development

I want to perfect making cards like this an aligning things properly, relying less on margins.

### Useful resources

- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) - Free photoshop alternative for figuring out the design when Figma is unavailable.
